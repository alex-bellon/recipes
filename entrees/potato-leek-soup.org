* Potato Leek Soup

** Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 cups chopped leeks, white and light green parts only (about 2 large)
- 1 cup chopped white onion (1/2 of a large onion)
- 3 cloves of garlic, peeled and roughly chopped, about 1 Tbsp
- 5 cups low-sodium chicken stock
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 bay leaves (optional)
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme, chopped (optional)
- 4 russet potatoes, peeled and cut up (2.5 lbs)
- 1/2 cup half and half

** Directions
- Add olive oil to a large pot over medium-low heat. Add leeks, onion, and garlic, and cook until translucent, about 7-8 minutes.
- Add chicken stock, salt, pepper, bay leaves, thyme, and potatoes. Bring to a simmer. Simmer until potatoes are soft, about 15-17 minutes. Remove bay leaves from pot.
- Using an immersion blender, process soup in the pot until smooth. Stir in half-and-half and simmer another 5 minutes. Garnish with thyme, chives, and a drizzle of olive oil, if youâ€™d like.
